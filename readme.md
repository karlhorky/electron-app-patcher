## Troubleshooting

### macOS Security Warning

Newer versions of macOS may prevent the app where you run the script from modifying apps on your computer and require you to allow access manually:

### Missing Notifications

If notifications do not appear after patching an app, you can create a self-signed certificate in your keychain and re-sign the app with this:

1. Open Keychain Access
2. Open the menu item Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Create a Certificate...
3. Choose a descriptive name for your certificate, for example `signal-self-signed-cert`
4. Under "Certificate Type", select "Code Signing"
5. Create the certificate

Then use the `codesign` command in your terminal to sign the patched app:

```bash
$ codesign --force --verbose=4 --sign <certificate name> <app path>
```

For example, for the certificate name `signal-self-signed-cert` and the app `Signal.app`, this would be:

```bash
$ codesign --force --verbose=4 --sign signal-self-signed-cert /Applications/Signal.app
```

After opening the newly re-signed app, you may receive a permissions prompt for access to confidential information in your keychain. Only allow access to information that you believe the app should have access to.
